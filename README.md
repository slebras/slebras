Hi,

I'm Sebastian. 

I'm a software engineer formerly at [10X Genomics](https://www.10xgenomics.com), working on computational biology QA.
Previously, I worked as a software engineer on the [KBase](https://kbase.us) project at [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://lbl.gov).

I enjoy working on impact projects in the sciences.
